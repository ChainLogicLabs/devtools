**TokenizedEconomyDevTools README**

### Overview:

TokenizedEconomyDevTools is a Solidity smart contract designed to securely connect assets to the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates the retrieval of asset prices from a trusted Oracle, ensuring transparent and reliable transactions in a tokenized economy.

### Usage:

1. **Customization:**
   - Modify the contract to suit the specific requirements of your tokenized assets.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the TokenizedEconomyDevTools contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Pass the address of the corresponding Pricing Oracle contract during deployment.

3. **Interaction:**
   - Users can interact with the contract to retrieve asset prices from the Oracle.
   - Utilize the provided JavaScript example code for interaction.

4. **Using with Other Assets:**
   - Deploy a new instance of TokenizedEconomyDevTools for each asset.
   - Specify the address of the corresponding Pricing Oracle contract during deployment.
   - Interact with each instance using the provided example code, replacing the asset symbol and contract address.

### Example Solidity Code:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Pricing Oracle Interface
interface PricingOracle {
    function getPrice(string memory asset) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract TokenizedEconomyDevTools {
    address public owner;

    // Modifier to restrict access to the owner only
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    // Constructor sets the contract owner
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Function to fetch price from a specific oracle for a given asset
    function getPriceFromOracle(address oracleAddress, string memory asset) external view returns (uint256) {
        PricingOracle oracle = PricingOracle(oracleAddress);
        return oracle.getPrice(asset);
    }

    // Function only accessible by the owner for demonstration purposes
    function exampleFunction() external onlyOwner {
        // Perform actions only the owner can do
    }
}

### Notes:

- Ensure the Pricing Oracle contract is deployed and its address is accurately passed during deployment.
- Verify that asset symbols in the contract match those used by the Pricing Oracle.
