**TokenizedEconomyDevTools README**

### Overview:

TokenizedEconomyDevTools is a Solidity smart contract designed to securely connect assets to the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates the retrieval of asset prices from a trusted Oracle, ensuring transparent and reliable transactions in a tokenized economy.

### Usage:

1. **Customization:**
   - Modify the contract to suit the specific requirements of your tokenized assets.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the TokenizedEconomyDevTools contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Pass the address of the corresponding Pricing Oracle contract during deployment.

3. **Interaction:**
   - Users can interact with the contract to retrieve asset prices from the Oracle.
   - Utilize the provided JavaScript example code for interaction.

4. **Using with Other Assets:**
   - Deploy a new instance of TokenizedEconomyDevTools for each asset.
   - Specify the address of the corresponding Pricing Oracle contract during deployment.
   - Interact with each instance using the provided example code, replacing the asset symbol.

### Example JavaScript Code:

```javascript
const web3 = new Web3('YOUR_WEB3_PROVIDER_URL');
const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

// Deployed address of TokenizedEconomyDevTools contract
const tokenizedEconomyDevToolsAddress = 'DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// Instantiate the contract
const tokenizedEconomyDevTools = new web3.eth.Contract(TokenizedEconomyDevToolsABI, tokenizedEconomyDevToolsAddress);

// Get the price of an asset from the Oracle
const asset = 'ETH/USD'; // Replace with the actual asset for which you want the price
const price = await tokenizedEconomyDevTools.methods.getPriceFromOracle(asset).call({ from: accounts[0] });

console.log(`The price of ${asset} is: ${price}`);
```

### Notes:

- Ensure the Pricing Oracle contract is deployed and its address is accurately passed during deployment.
- Verify that asset symbols in the contract match those used by the Pricing Oracle.
